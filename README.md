# Team Up

> Find people to play together

## Overview

Repo for the https://teamupgaming.net website front-end. This might be seem for recruiters, however the project was made as a POC of a business venture, so I'm well aware that the architecture is not the best possible and there might even be be practices that I know are not the ideal ones. It was in the first place a venture, then I decided to open it so anyone can have at least a shallow idea of my programming.

Website made as a alternative to not so active forums, where you post requests to find people to play together and find a forgotten place. This platform has the ambition to be a hub for this end. The site is currently in its bare minimum version, truly a MVP. Depending on its traction, I intent to add functionalities and upgrades.

The back-end repo can be found in my profile too as "teamup".
